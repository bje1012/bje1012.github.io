I am a Ph.D. student in Political Science at the University of South Carolina. I received my M.A. in <a href='https://politics.ntu.edu.tw/english/'>Political Science from National Taiwan University (Taiwan) </a>, and a B.A.A. in <a href='https://www.sogang.ac.kr/en/university-graduate-school/business-school'>Business Administration</a> and a B.A. in Chinese Culture from Sogang University (South Korea).

My research focuses on the dynamics within intrastate wars, with a particular emphasis on third-party interventions. It examines the strategic decision-making processes that influence the duration and outcomes of civil conflicts, and the role of major regional powers as third-party sponsors to the war.
