“Determining Duration: How Types of External Support Shape Civil Conflicts”
<details>
      <summary><b>abstract</b></summary>
      This paper examines how different types of state external support—material, non-material, and funding—affect the duration of civil conflicts by focusing on the commitment problems and the costs and benefits to state patrons. This study categorizes external support based on consumability, transfer requirements, and observability, examining how these characteristics uniquely influence the decision-making process among state patrons, governments, and rebels. I argue that while material, non-material, and funding supports from external sources each affect the information problem differently, they all evoke commitment problems in distinct ways, leading to extended war durations when rebels receive any type of support among these three. However, the costs and benefits to state patrons can also influence the duration of the war, as they determine the varying impacts of these provisions. Since non-material support and funding impose a lesser burden on state patrons, I contend that conflicts involving rebels with these types of support are likely to last longer than those with material support. Using the UCDP External Support Dataset and a Cox Proportional Hazards model, this paper empirically tests these theoretical expectations, concluding that non-material support and funding exert more leverage in prolonging civil conflicts compared to material support. The results provide insights into how third-party interventions, driven by the varied interests and strategic objectives of external state sponsors, shape the duration of civil conflicts.

“China in Myanmar: Understanding Motives and Modes of Intervention in Civil Conflict”

<details>
      <summary><b>abstract</b></summary>
      This study investigates the conditions under which China intervenes in Myanmar’s long-running civil war, focusing on the motivations and timing of support for either the Myanmar government or rebel groups. Despite increasing recognition of China’s role as a regional hegemon with deep economic and security interests in Myanmar, existing literature lacks a systematic, data-driven analysis of its interventions. To address this gap, the study develops an original dataset of Chinese interventions from 2010 to 2024, including diplomatic, economic, and political activities not captured in existing sources. The analysis examines whether conflict intensity near the Chinese border, fatalities near key infrastructure like the China-Myanmar pipeline, and overall war fatalities influence China's decision to intervene—and the form such intervention takes. The findings aim to clarify the strategic logic of third-party involvement in civil wars and contribute to broader debates on foreign intervention, regional security, and the economic dimensions of international conflict.
